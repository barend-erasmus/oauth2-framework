# OAuth2 Framework

The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party    application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on    behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction    between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the    third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.

## Support

* Authorization Code Grant
* Implicit Grant
* Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant
